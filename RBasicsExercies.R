# What is tow to the power of five


#Create a vector called stock.prices with the following data points: 23,27,23,21,34
stock.prices <- c(23, 27, 23, 21, 34)
stock.prices

# Assign names to the price data points relating to the day of the week, starting with Mon, Tue, Wed, etc...
stock.names <- c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri")
stock.names

names(stock.prices) <- stock.names
names(stock.prices)
stock.prices

#What was the average (mean) stock price for the week? (You may need to reference a built-in function)
mean(stock.prices)

#Create a vector called over.23 consisting of logicals that correspond to the days where the stock price was more than $23
stock.prices > 23

#Use the over.23 vector to filter out the stock.prices vector and only return the day and prices where the price was over $23
print(stock.prices > 23)

#Use a built-in function to find the day the price was the highest
max(stock.prices)
names(max(stock.prices))
